## Enhancing Cybersecurity in IoT Networks: Effective Detection of Cyber Attacks.

The rapid rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) has transformed our lives, introducing groundbreaking concepts like smart devices, healthcare, industry, cities, and grids. However, this growth has also sparked significant concerns about security, especially in the healthcare sector, where recent attacks have exploited vulnerabilities in medical IoT devices. These vulnerabilities pose a serious threat to patient safety and confidentiality, as attackers can gain access to sensitive medical data or even manipulate critical equipment. To address this growing challenge, researchers are turning to machine learning (ML) as a powerful tool for detecting and preventing cyberattacks targeting healthcare systems. By applying ML algorithms to analyze large datasets of medical device activity, researchers aim to identify patterns indicative of malicious behavior. This proactive approach provides a crucial line of defense against cyber threats, enabling healthcare institutions to detect and respond to attacks before they can cause significant harm. The integration of ML offers a promising solution for enhancing the security of healthcare IoT devices. By continuously learning and adapting to new threats, ML-powered systems can provide real-time protection and ensure the safety of patients and sensitive medical data.
